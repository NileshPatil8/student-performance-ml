Developed a Student Grade Prediction model using XGBoost. Performed data cleaning, removed low-impact features, engineered a final grade metric, applied one-hot encoding, and analyzed feature correlations. Trained and evaluated the model using MSE and R², plotted actual vs predicted grades, and saved the final XGBoost model for deployment
